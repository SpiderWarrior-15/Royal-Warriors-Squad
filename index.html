      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>This group was started quite unexpectedly by MM. Yoosuf, and it quickly grew into something meaningful. It was then developed and shaped further by MJ. Mash-har Faizy and MIM. Aahil, who brought in fresh ideas and structure. As the group evolved, we invited a few of our closest friends to join us, creating a tight-knit community built on trust, friendship, and shared goals. Among us, Aazim stands out as our most active and committed member, always contributing with energy and passion. Our activities continue to grow, and we look forward to building something even greater together. üåü</p>
